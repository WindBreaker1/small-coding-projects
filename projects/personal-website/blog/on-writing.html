      <h1>On Writing</h1>
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Writing is the art form of putting your thoughts in the physical world, whether that be on paper or on your computer screen. Yes, I said that it is an art form, just like painting and music. It is a valid art form just like any other because it takes creativity to write well.</p>
      <p>The difference between a decent writer and a master writer is as apparent as a beginner musician to a veteran one.</p>

      <h2 id="what-does-writing-mean-to-me-">What Does Writing Mean To Me?</h2>
      <p>I have written and drawn stories since I could remember. Writing has been an integral part of my life and will remain an integral part of my life.</p>

      <h2 id="everybody-should-write">Everybody Should Write</h2>
      <p>Whether you&#39;re a child, still learning of the world, an adult, sick of your responsibilities, or an old person, stuck with their aching body, everybody should write.</p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>We often disregard our thoughts or think on them a little too much, but we never sit with them and ponder them the right amount of time, until we&#39;re satisficed.</p>
      <p>By giving form to these formless thoughts, you will see the question right in front of you. You will see the five tasks that you need to do today right in front of you. You will see an idea that no one has ever thought of before right in front of you.</p>
      <p>Only then can you more easily act upon these questions and ideas.</p>
      <p>Don&#39;t let your brilliant ideas be lost in the mountain of useless thoughts.</p>
      <p>Also, writing is therapeutic.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="what-should-you-write-about-">What Should You Write About?</h2>
      <p>You should write about your thoughts, pains, ideas. You should write questions that you ask yourself everyday and try to find an answer, instead of waving them off and returning to your mediocre life.</p>
      <p>You should write the story that you&#39;ve had in your head for the past years but never put pen to paper because of various reasons that we all tell ourselves:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>It will take too long.</li>
      <li>I don&#39;t have enough time.</li>
      <li>I won&#39;t publish it anyway.</li>
      <li>It&#39;s childish.</li>
      <li>It&#39;s embarrassing.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="when-you-don-t-want-to-write">When You Don&#39;t Want To Write</h2>
      <p>Don&#39;t write.</p>
      <p>Creativity can&#39;t be forced, however much you want to believe that. Whatever you put on paper while in a state of disregard for your work will be bad, without exception.</p>
      <p>You need emotions when writing, you need to care.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, when you don&#39;t want to write you should:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Take a walk.</li>
      <li>Go to your favorite restaurant or cafÃ©.</li>
      <li>Exercise.</li>
      <li>Work on another project.</li>
      <li>Have fun with another hobby.</li>
      <li>Do anything else that you enjoy doing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By separating yourself from writing, you will come back to it with fresh eyes.</p>
      <p>Just like you should give your romantic partner space, you should give your pursuits space, so your desire to come back to them burns brighter.</p>

      <p>What apps do I use to enhance my writing?</p>
      <p>I use <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to write my notes and novels.</p>
