        <h1>On Rest & Relaxation</h1>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Rest is an action performed for peace of mind, body and spirit.</p>
        <p>Rest is important because our bodies and minds don’t have infinite energy. That is why we need sleep.</p>
        <p>Seneca warned us against a life full of busyness. <em>“If we’re busy all the time, life lacks essential rhythm. […] As if we are back in the hammock, we should swing back and forth between activity and rest, taking the latter as seriously as the former.”</em></p>

        <h2 id="fatigue">Fatigue</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"Modern work practices, modern lifestyles and modern technology have combined and conspired to make life in the early twenty-first century ceaselessly demanding."</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This incessant busyness leads to tiredness. Tiredness leads to memory lapses, a lack of concentrations and impaired judgments.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="micro-breaks">Micro-Breaks</h2>
        <p>Micro-breaks are breaks of 5 seconds or less to pause and reflect.</p>
        <p>You can also think about it as a mini-meditation session.</p>
        <p>This helps you get out of long periods of procrastination and busyness.</p>
        <p>Let's say you've been scrolling on your phone for an hour straight. A micro-break might be just what you need to get out of that trance.</p>
        <p>My micro-breaks are a little different. Every time I find myself sitting for long periods of time or procrastinating, I get up and do some jumping jacks, or run in place. This achieves a mental reset and it also helps my body.</p>

        <h2 id="what-are-the-best-ways-to-rest">What are the best ways to rest?</h2>
        <p>According to a survey done by Claudia Hammond and featured in The Art of Rest, the ten best ways to rest are: </p>
        <ol>
        <li value="10">Mindfulness</li>
        <li value="9">Watching TV</li>
        <li value="8">Daydreaming</li>
        <li value="7">A Nice Hot Bath</li>
        <li value="6">A Good Walk</li>
        <li value="5">Doing Nothing In Particular</li>
        <li value="4">Listening To Music</li>
        <li value="3">I Want To Be Alone</li>
        <li value="2">Spending Time In Nature</li>
        <li value="1">Reading</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You might already be doing some of these already, but I highly encourage you to practice some other ways of resting that you may have never tried.</p>
        <p>Different ways of rest may charge your batteries better than others.</p>
