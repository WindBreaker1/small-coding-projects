        <h1>On Learning</h1>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Learning is about curiosity and excitement about the world around you.</p>
        <p>This is a general post about learning. For a more in-depth look about how to learn check out <a href="how-to-learn.html">this post</a> on how to learn.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="continuous-learning">Continuous Learning</h2>
        <p>Curiosity requires that you&nbsp;<strong>constantly ask great questions</strong>&nbsp;at the heart of important quality-of-life issues, then&nbsp;<strong>search intensely for answers</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
          <li>Keep a journal to jot down new notes, questions and ideas.</li>
          <li>Choose a daily theme (emotions, animals, science) and learn everything you can about that theme.</li>
          <li>Ask the right questions.</li>
          <li>Contemplate your ideas and actions.</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="journaling">Journaling</h3>
        <p>Check out my post on <a href="on-journaling.html">journaling</a> to learn more about it.</p>
        <h3 id="choosing-a-daily-theme">Choosing a daily theme</h3>
        <p>Choosing a daily theme helps you become more focused.</p>
        <h3 id="asking-the-right-questions">Asking the right questions</h3>
        <p>Asking the right questions means acting on the balance between your passions and things that are important.</p>
        <h3 id="contemplation">Contemplation</h3>
        <p>Contemplation is the act of stopping and thinking. Moving forward isn't always the answer.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="test-knowledge-via-practical-experience">Test Knowledge via Practical Experience</h2>
        <p><strong>First-hand experience</strong>&nbsp;(including disasters, failures and mistakes) is the best way to test and improve on existing practices, and to develop new wisdom, know-how and independent thinking.</p>
        <h3 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h3>
        <p>An alternative to questions is hypotheses. A hypothesis, in essence, is an if-then statement: "If I put my running shoes next to my bed in the morning, then it will be easier for me to go outside and run." or "If I start learning how to code today, then I will have mastered a programming language in one year."</p>
        <h3 id="getting-out-of-the-comfort-zone">Getting out of the comfort zone</h3>
        <p>You cannot test your knowledge in the real world without getting out of your comfort zone.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="sharpen-the-senses">Sharpen The Senses</h2>
        <p>Our five senses â€“ sight, sound, touch, taste and smell â€“ are the doorways to our daily experiences. By increasing the amount and quality of sensory information you take in each day, you increase both your intelligence and your ability to learn from the world around you.</p>
        <p>The expression 'Stop and smell the roses' couldn't be more important in the twenty-first century. With overstimulation ruining society, it is very important we take a step back from the colors and lights and constant excitement of the modern world.</p>
        <h3 id="how-to-be-more-present">How to be more present</h3>
        <p>Let's say you're researching how to cook healthier and tastier meals. Don't just learn how to cook it. When eating, try to recognize each ingredient. Practice gratitude for the good food that you're eating.</p>
        <p>Use more of your senses when experiencing the world, not just your sight.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="be-comfortable-with-ambiguity">Be Comfortable With Ambiguity</h2>
        <p>As you apply the first 3 principles, youâ€™ll inevitably face the unknown. With a high tolerance for ambiguity, you can remain calm, effective and creative in face of uncertainty, instead of being flustered and fearful.</p>
        <p>This has ties with your mindset.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="balance-science--art-logic--imagination">Balance Science &amp; Art, Logic &amp; Imagination</h2>
        <p>Be curious about all subjects.</p>
        <p>Being called "a jack of all trades and master of none" is supposed to discourage you from pursuing many passions and ideas, but you should do the opposite.</p>
        <p>You should be a jack of all trades and master of some. You can be someone like that, a complex person that has dabbled in every idea and topic, but that recognizes their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="balance-of-body--mind">Balance of Body &amp; Mind</h2>
        <p>To have a healthy mind, you have to have a healthy body.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="life-is-all-about-connections">Life is All About Connections</h2>
        <p>Think: how is everything connected?</p>
