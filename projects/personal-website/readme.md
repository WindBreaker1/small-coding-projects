## Ideas

### Idle-finity/Idle Clicker

An idle game made with React.

- Press the big red button to get a click.
- Use clicks to buy production upgrades to get clicks per second.
- Use clicks to buy one-time upgrades for a big boost.
- Minigames like snake, heads or tails, dice rolls and even a mini-rpg, with juicy rewards!
- Reset everything and earn prestige points (PP).
